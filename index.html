          "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
          Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other
          people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out
          your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
          your heart and intuition."
